# Delivery of functionality via PL

* what gets popular what does not?
  - hard to learn
  - cumbersome to use
  - "magic"

Cons:

* PL is hard to change
   - does not work well with agile incremental development
   - very hard to avoid idiosyncrasies / inconsistencies
   - hard to do without operational semantics
   - compilation warnings slow deprecation path
   - many tools are no longer free (e.g. app registry)
   - _all fixes are breaking_

* deprecation tools are needed
   - compilation warnings
   - compilation flags

* logic-solver engineering challenges
   - different way of thinking
   - "magic"
   - does not work well with agile incremental development
   - expanding solution space (bug fix, adding atom) is breaking
   - error handling
   - not a pure logic solver, has dynamic component - use populated fields to populate the rest static exponential blowout

Pros:

* PL approach is powerful
   - small targeted PL with strong type checker
   - ability to expose powerful patterns not available in mainstream PLs
   - compilation warnings are a powerfull tool

* specific benefits
   - simplified UI
   - HTTP endpoint manipulation
