start with a talk looking at presentation abstract
explain what we will cover:

Chronological order:
- old Haskell apps used logic solver to populate data. How to do logic solver in py?
- logic solver needs types (GraphQL like language)
- we get JSON type safety
- JSON data <-> UI mapping

  __intersting bit is combining HTTP endpoints__
- logic solver creates "expression" for a type
  expression uses existing endpoints to populate data
  - expressions
  - molecules
